</footer><!-- /.post-info -->        <p>So... A lot has happened in the past few days. I won't necessarily talk about all of it here, first off because my family has the superstition that talking about things before they happen is very bad luck, and second off because I still kind of want to keep BBCF talk in the BBCF notes section. I'll make a post about the first thing if/when it gets confirmed for certain.</p>
<p>The thing I <em>can</em> talk about is my early presentation of my thesis went well, and I think that was overall good because it made me get a clear picture of the work I've done in the past year and now it shouldn't be too hard to write its chapter in my thesis and submit it as a poster somewhere.</p>
<p>I'm taking today as a slow day after the emotional roller coaster of the past two-ish weeks. Going to see if I can't do some household things and (calmly) work on some of the work I've been behind on. I'm also going to maybe go out to eat to celebrate the thing I can't talk about yet, since I know there's a burger place near me that doesn't mind people pulling out their laptops and working at the bar during lunchtime. My arthritis is kicking my ass again so I don't know how much I'll want to get out of the house even for good food, though.</p>
<p>I've said this before, but hopefully I'll edit this at the end of the day with more interesting things. I'm hoping to get a little more work done on my sprite tool, now that I'm not in do or die mode.</p>

<p>Nice, my blog pagination finally broke! I'll try to fix that tonight.</p>
