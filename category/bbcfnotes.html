        Congratulations! You found my hidden BBCF notes page. (It's not actually that hidden, you should be able to find it by practically just searching "BBCF".) Enjoy various notes I've written about my experiences grinding BBCF like a frickin' lunatic.

</footer><!-- /.post-info --><p>Interesting series of BBCF days. I'd kind of burnt out, but then I had a vod review with Z of my Ikaruga run that I mentioned in my previous post, and that helped a <em>lot</em>. </p>
<p>I was supposed to not be around for TMN, but then I cancelled plans because I was too stressed to deal with it. I ended up around but I realized while I was happy to play, I had no interest in actually playing versus anyone let alone being competitive. Same deal for TRO, I won't be around, but honestly, I'm not in the mood to actually play right now so even if I was I'd probably skip. Good change in mentality from before, when I forced myself to join tournaments even if I wasn't feeling it and burning myself more. Seems basically right now I'm just in a training mode kinda mood with the occasional "@PC(Steam) kick my ass ft5" ping in the matchmaking disc.</p>
<h3 id="should-work-on">should work on</h3>
<p>Seems like the main things I have to work on right now are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Very intentional stagger pressure.</li>
</ul>
<p>Right now I just kind of do my auto blockstrings that have 0 gaps until specific predictable points, which means people feel free to just kind of mash because they won't be punished and they'll hit me in the teeth once I hit a reset. I need to start adding 1-2 frame gaps to try and catch them, so they actually have to respect my pressure so I can start doing the risky pressure like overheads and grabs again.</p>
<ul>
<li>Practice a few new combos.</li>
</ul>
<p>I was missing some very basic cash-out combos. For example, 6c ch 22cccc I don't have to use OD; I can just cancel right into fuenjiin for a solid 5.5k-ish damage and keep OD for the next round.</p>
<p>I also was using the combo piece 22cccc ODR 666d 6321466d which is a little tight. Turns out instead I can do: 22cccc ODR j.c jc j.c j.2d 4d jc j.c jc j.c j.2d, etc.</p>
<p>Also in the corner after 22cccc, I used to do gc 2b 5c 2c 4d jc j.c j.2d 4d jc j.2d 632146d, but turns out that was very difficult for only a little more damage. Instead, I can do 22cccc straight into ODR 6d 632146d.</p>
<p>Z also mentioned that below 75 meter, dp super does more damage than fuenjiin, so I gotta keep that in mind.</p>
<ul>
<li>Use j.2d</li>
</ul>
<p>In my ikaruga set I was getting countered by the simple strategy of "run at them", Z pointed out that j.2d would stop that kind of approach, so I'm trying to train myself to do that more.</p>
<h3 id="want-to-work-on">want to work on</h3>
<p>And the things I'm working on even though they're not <em>really</em> necessary are:</p>
<ul>
<li>6a back ch confirms</li>
</ul>
<p>I keep hitting people with the back 6a (probably because I microdash 6a too often when I should just stand still) and not being able to pick it up so I dumped a bunch of time into trying to figure out how to properly confirm it. People told me the best strategy was just treating it like a normal confirm and picking it up with 5b, but my gut reaction to landing one was iad j.c so I decided to try to finesse that reaction instead of trying to replace it.</p>
<p>I managed to find a confirm with iad j.c 5c into bnb. It's still height dependent, but my rule of thumb is I need to hit j.c so it connects when they're either at my height or just below my height, since then it'll push them high enough that they don't hit the ground but not be too high for me to hit with both hits of 5c. If I was <em>really</em> cool, I'd jc 5c if I saw it was too high to fully connect.</p>
<p>(This is the first time I've "made up" a confirm, so I'm pretty proud of it.)</p>
<p>Now I need to try to land this confirm mid match so I can send a clip to everyone who said "Now land it in a match!".</p>
<p><em>(Update: I got sent a way cooler confirm I'm going to learn too, because it has 6D(1) in it which I want to learn how to do.)</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Cleaner resets</li>
</ul>
<p>My resets are still super predictable. I need to fold more j.2d into my pressure and do more short strings that I short circuit into 6b, j.2d or even just dash up in. This really depends on me fixing my main blockstring to catch mashers, though, because otherwise people'll just mash the shit out of me on every reset.</p>
<ul>
<li>Work on ACTUALLY jc 5c</li>
</ul>
<p>I've been doing it a shitton in training mode but for some reason in match I still just don't jc my 5c. I need to make it <em>actually</em> happen mid match.</p>                        </article>
