        Congratulations! You found my hidden BBCF notes page. (It's not actually that hidden, you should be able to find it by practically just searching "BBCF".) Enjoy various notes I've written about my experiences grinding BBCF like a frickin' lunatic.

</footer><!-- /.post-info --><p>It was mostly a fine BBCF day at first? TMN was fine. </p>
<p>Heads up that this is a little bit emo so feel free to skip to a section or whatever if you want. Just need to get this off my chest, and if I can't write about it in my personal blog, what the fuck's the point of this blog?</p>
<p>I got some good practice matches in with Augo, and I think I actually really like the Kagura matchup even though I think it's Kagura-favored. It's explosive, and that's kind of fun.</p>
<p>I almost took my first set today. Would have been neat, but I didn't respect Bullet's drives enough.</p>
<p>I could have won my second set but I didn't respect the size of Es' buttons. That bothered me a little because again I lost something I should've won but I turned off my brain and ran into stuff.</p>
<p>Biggest issue is I looked at the seeding afterwards. No offense to the person I was seeded below, they're a great person and I'm sure they're going to do great as they keep playing. They'll undoubtedly outpace me, but like... it sure was something to see myself seeded below them when I've literally been on their stream and beat the everliving crud against them before.</p>
<p>Kind of sent me a little bit into a crisis of faith because like... what's the point? I apparently never impress anybody and at this rate I'm never going to be given the chance to. Like, fuck, man. I thought I was finally making some moves, even despite arthritis locking up my joints like no tomorrow, even despite showing everyone how much I was absolute trash by trying to connect to people when I first started playing. I started playing <em>fighting games as a whole</em> last fall, and I've gotten this far. Yet I'm still placed below people that I thought I proved I could beat because that's where people think I belong. </p>
<p>But whatever.</p>
<p>That's not why I play this game, I play it cus it's fun. And I can see myself getting better, it doesn't matter if people I know don't think I am, I guess. I shouldn't be taking all this shit personally anyways cus the TO's got enough going on, they don't have to deal with me being a dramatic bitch too.</p>
<p>Plus I need to not forget, there are people I know who have very explicitly told me that I'm improving and they can see it. Need to make my shitty brain shut up and remember that just because some people don't see it, doesn't mean it's not true. There are people who do see it.</p>
<p>Fuzz showed up in my lobby today. Kinda wish I could have gotten a game in with him, little bit of a "senpai notice me" kinda deal since his Hazama is fucking amazing. He doesn't tag me in his Terumi posts on NOL so he probably still doesn't know who I am. Not gonna reach out to him because why would he give me the time of day. I'd just embarass myself anyways. Same deal with DGF. Would love to fight him and see his Terumi in a game, but I'm not gonna bother him.</p>
<p>I'm glad I at least have contact with Zander so I'm not afraid to reach out to him occasionally. My sparring buddy (can I call him that at this point? idk) of course has a great Terumi, we're just.. definitely too used to playing eachother at this point with how much bullshit we do only works because it's the particular person we're playing. (s/o to the fact we both IAD grab round start multiple times a set.)</p>
<p>Got lotta games in with my usual sparring partner. He beat my ass as usual, but I got the chance to get some 6a practice in and I took a few matches despite being an emotional and physical wreck.</p>
<h2>Notes</h2>
<p>6a progress is going not bad. I'm using it now. I'm able to confirm it with both 2D and a jc j.c, but now I need to work on getting the [6]b confirm out.</p>
<p>Still need to work on movement. Copied from yesterday's:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dash barrier block.</li>
<li>In the corner: 9 jump with immediate BB.</li>
<li>96 dash. I keep doing 766 which is way way way too predictable.</li>
</ul>
<p>Also I've lost some combos, somehow.</p>
<ul>
<li>Stop fucking up my 4d j.b j.c jc j.c j.2d combo.</li>
<li>Need to get 6c -&gt; 22cccc -&gt; OD -&gt; 66d -&gt; 6321466d consistent again.</li>
</ul>
<p>I randomly started getting better at bullshitting combos, though. Landed some nice freestyles today, so I might be actually learning how moves go into each other.</p>
<p>Not many other notes today. I'm sure I can find something but this is plenty to work on for now so no reason to. Maybe I'll find something when I go back over my vods.</p>                        </article>

</footer><!-- /.post-info --><p>Not a great BBCF day, to be honest. Was probably a bad idea to play while still being murdered by arthritis. Got advice, fought some even matches, got obliterated by a Jin/Hakumen after they finished warming up. Would love to get more matches with them, but I won't put their name here so SEO doesn't air out my dirty laundry, because when I search them I only see Ghost's VOD vs their Ragna.</p>
<h2>TL;DR :</h2>
<p>Work on 66bb, 9bb, 96, and 6a jc confirm.</p>
<h2>Full Notes :</h2>
<p>Some notes from those matches:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hakumen thrives on predictable stagger. Either keep things tight or keep things intentionally not tight to catch him on his counter's recovery.</li>
<li>Try to mix up high/lows if I am being predictable in my stagger so he has to choose between countering high or countering low.</li>
<li>Watch today's saved replays from that Jin/Hakumen.</li>
</ul>
<p>Other thoughts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Still need to get better at 6a.</li>
<li>Practice immediately jump cancelling into the air combo. I'm losing too much by defaulting to 2D and whiffing.</li>
<li>Still also practice 6a into [6]b to have it if I ever have the reaction to realize I've counterhit without expecting it.</li>
<li>Lab out better expected 6a CH combos with 2D. My [6]b combo shouldn't be doing more damage than it.</li>
<li>Practice 6C -&gt; 22CCCC -&gt; OD -&gt; 66D -&gt; 6321466D . I shouldn't be dropping it this often and it's VERY important.</li>
<li>Practice microdash 2c or just straight up 2c instead of trying to microdash 2a all the time.</li>
<li>Watch more DGF/Zander and see how they do oki. I'm still not timing my (hit) -&gt; 6C -&gt; 236D (whiff) right. I'm getting either mashed out or grab countered, which is besides the whole point.</li>
<li>Zander said my pressure is still linear. Keep an eye on my habits when I make my compilation video to see if I can spot it. (Already I know I have the habit of doing a low -&gt; 2 mids -&gt; high ; the hakumen beat the shit out of me for it.)</li>
</ul>
<p>Things I gotta just grind out in practice mode:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dash barrier block.</li>
<li>In the corner: 9 jump with immediate BB.</li>
<li>96 dash. I keep doing 766 which is way way way too predictable.</li>
</ul>
<p>... Yeah I definitely need to cut down this list and pick one particular thing to worry about. Executive decision: Ignore the Hakumen-specific MU notes, and instead focus on my movement (66 bb, 9bb, 96) and 6A usage.</p>
