        Congratulations! You found my hidden BBCF notes page. (It's not actually that hidden, you should be able to find it by practically just searching "BBCF".) Enjoy various notes I've written about my experiences grinding BBCF like a frickin' lunatic.

</footer><!-- /.post-info --><p>It was mostly a fine BBCF day at first? TMN was fine. </p>
<p>Heads up that this is a little bit emo so feel free to skip to a section or whatever if you want. Just need to get this off my chest, and if I can't write about it in my personal blog, what the fuck's the point of this blog?</p>
<p>I got some good practice matches in with Augo, and I think I actually really like the Kagura matchup even though I think it's Kagura-favored. It's explosive, and that's kind of fun.</p>
<p>I almost took my first set today. Would have been neat, but I didn't respect Bullet's drives enough.</p>
<p>I could have won my second set but I didn't respect the size of Es' buttons. That bothered me a little because again I lost something I should've won but I turned off my brain and ran into stuff.</p>
<h3 id="edit">EDIT:</h3>
<p>I got over it. :) Unironically. Ranting about it helped. Removing a lot of this because I named a lot of people by name and I don't want to get screwed by people finding this accidentally by searching people's names. If there's one thing you need to know about me it's that I will feel things to the max and I do my best to make sure other people don't get affected by it, because I'll get over it. (That's part of why I'm glad I started fighting games so late; if I started earlier, I wouldn't have been so practiced in getting over it and I probably would have crashed out explosively.)</p>
<p>Got lotta games in with my usual sparring buddy (I think I can call him that?) today. He beat my ass as usual, but I got the chance to get some 6a practice in and I took a few matches despite being an emotional and physical wreck.</p>
<h2 id="notes">Notes</h2>
<p>6a progress is going not bad. I'm using it now. I'm able to confirm it with both 2D and a jc j.c, but now I need to work on getting the [6]b confirm out.</p>
<p>Still need to work on movement. Copied from yesterday's:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dash barrier block.</li>
<li>In the corner: 9 jump with immediate BB.</li>
<li>96 dash. I keep doing 766 which is way way way too predictable.</li>
</ul>
<p>Also I've lost some combos, somehow.</p>
<ul>
<li>Stop fucking up my 4d j.b j.c jc j.c j.2d combo.</li>
<li>Need to get 6c -&gt; 22cccc -&gt; OD -&gt; 66d -&gt; 6321466d consistent again.</li>
</ul>
<p>I randomly started getting better at bullshitting combos, though. Landed some nice freestyles today, so I might be actually learning how moves go into each other.</p>
<p>Not many other notes today. I'm sure I can find something but this is plenty to work on for now so no reason to. Maybe I'll find something when I go back over my vods.</p>                    </article>

Got advice, fought some even matches, got obliterated by a Jin/Hakumen after they finished warming up. Would love to get more matches with them, but I won't put â€¦</p>
