</footer><!-- /.post-info --><p>Not really much to update this with yet, but I wanted to make a post. I feel like that one meme of Ben Affleck standing there with a cigarette as I'm being brutally forced (by myself) to learn to properly follow C# programming conventions.</p>
<p>My python-focused development experience is causing some pretty intense miscommunications and... strange approaches from my end that's making this all way more complicated than it needs to be. I'm glad I'm learning that now and not later.</p>
<p>I added functions that just read bytes but make sure that they're empty. I have a few regions that I'm assuming are just padding, but I'm putting them through these functions just to make sure, so if I ever get a file where that assumption doesn't hold I can tell immediately.</p>
<p>I added a few more labels. I labelled <code>stage</code>, <code>music</code>, <code>palette</code>. There's 4 values (<code>Unknownx1c=10</code>,<code>Unknownx304=1</code>, <code>Unknownx308=6</code>, <code>Unknownx31c=1</code>) that always have the exact same value, so I added a test to make sure that holds. I might just add an exception to the <code>ReplayHeader</code> class instead so I can stop mis-using the test project. My guess is these have something to do with the game mode, since these were all player room matches set to ordinary matches (rather than like, practice room or free-for-all vs. match/spectate.)</p>
<p>I also have been reading everything as <code>uint</code> and parsing it into an <code>int</code> in attributes, which might not be the right way to go about it. <code>Unknownx08</code> has to be a <code>uint</code> becaues it can reach values that turn negative as an <code>int</code>. I made a note of that and future me will deal with it, because I'm not using <code>Unknownx08</code> right now anyways.</p>
<p>I'm going to update the <code>BBCFReplayConsole</code> project to have better verbs. My friend pointed out that I can just adjust the command line arguments to accept multiple files, and even combinations of files and folders. That'll make it easier to generate <code>.json</code> translations of various files. For now that's shoe-horned into the <code>BBCFReplayLib.Test</code> project, which isn't all that appropriate.</p>
<p>... It's been two days and I forgot what else I was going to put here, so I'm just going to start a new post when I do. ADHD things, baybee!!!</p>                        </article>
