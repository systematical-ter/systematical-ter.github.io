<p>I have a blog now, and that's pretty neat! It's made using <a href="https://getpelican.com/">Pelican</a>, and I have a script that takes my (private) source repository, compiles it, and pushes the output to the (public) repository that actually gets automatically made into a github pages website. That part was all fine and dandy!</p>
<h2>Using Visual Editors</h2>
<p>I decided to make life difficult for myself, though, and wanted to be able to edit the content using <a href="https://obsidian.md/">Obsidian</a>, a little application I use when I need to write a lot of markdown files for notes or a guide or something. That was a little bit annoying, because I do my python coding in WSL, so the repository containing my blog <code>.md</code> is on the WSL file system. Trying to just point the windows Obsidian install to that folder caused a bunch of file read errors, so I went ahead and installed Obsidian on WSL itself.</p>
<p>I downloaded the <code>.deb</code> file, installed it, and then futzed around making it so my WSL2 install could actually run visual applications (because what's the point of all of this if I can't run linux visual apps, right?) Turns out I had to run a quick:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="k">export</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">DISPLAY</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="mi">0</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>... and it magically started working. Neat! (I probably have to do this every time I start a new terminal until I figure out where it's setting <code>$DISPLAY</code> to anything else.)</p>
<p>... And it was at this point I realized... I could probably just use VSCode instead. Oh well! I'll probably just use that next time and nuke Obsidian off my WSL, since it keeps trying to make folders in my root directory and I don't want it to do that.</p>
<h2>Life Updates</h2>
<p>Arthritis is a solid 4/10 today. Better than yesterday's 6/10, but not great. I got a thumbs up from my hematologist to use Aleve at most once or twice a week with my low dose of blood thinners, but I don't really want to fuck with it too much so I'll just grit and deal with it for today until my rheumatologist gets back to me about other options. I'm glad I found a heatpack.</p>
<p>One of my classmates came to the office today with Mono, so that was... annoying. (Context: I am immune compromised, and I get sick at the slightest provocation and stay sick for weeks.) I have an interview scheduled in a week, a semi-monthly to go to, and two thesis chapters to write, so I don't need that shit in my life right now. I put on a mask but then quickly peaced out after saying hi to a collaborator that was visiting.</p>
<p>(Still blows my mind that people think that's just... okay. Even if I wasn't immune compromised, why make other people sick? Anyways, I'm too close to getting myself into a tizzy, so I'm leaving the rant there for now.)</p>
<h2>Fun things</h2>
<p>I have a few things in mind to make creatively:</p>
<p><strong>"I do not control the rate at which lobsters die", but with a twist: "I do not control the rate at which <em>I lock in</em>", especially accurate after I completely locked myself out yesterday.</strong></p>
<p>I was too hype? excited? confused? about the fact there was finally a Terumi (and it was Zander, nonetheless!) in a bracket I watched... only for it to be a mirror match I was playing in on stream... to lock in. I played real bad, dropped a really easy combo to take my possibly only round, but thankfully none of the existential self-doubt set in. Plus, I had some fun casuals with him after so that was a positive note to end on.</p>
<p><strong>A proper Terumi keychain.</strong></p>
<p>I made my silly little emote one, but I still have one that's 90% finished I should actually finish, and I want to make a not-chibi version at some point because believe it or not, I actually really don't like chibi art. It's just what is fast enough to do so I actually finish it.</p>
<p><strong>My next match compilation video.</strong></p>
<p>I accidentally put off making my next one for a WHOLE MONTH, so now I have 60 matches to watch to cherry pick into only the best 30 mins of footage. Even at only 3 minutes per match, that's <em>three hours</em> of watch time... I might have to watch them at 2x speed. Plus I always feel bad about picking only wins, so I have some weird standard of "interesting-ness" I'm basing my choice of matches on instead that really slows the whole process down.</p>
<p><strong>More emotes.</strong></p>
<p>I don't have specific plans yet, but I'm happy that I finally have some twitch emotes. Now I gotta make a few more so I can start using them in random places. (That reminds me that I need to add that Pelican module that lets you use custom emoji so I can throw them in here too.)</p>
<h2>Bye-bye now!</h2>
<p>(Insert Gin Ichimaru clip here.)</p>
<p>You can find me on bluesky <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/systematical.bsky.social">here</a> and on youtube <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNJoOANdZSmxZA2m-D5aTBQ">here</a> and on twitch <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/systematical">here</a>. Some day I'll finish branding all of these various places. 'Til I get comments or whatever set up on this blog -- if I do so at all -- feel free to send me a message on bluesky or Discord if you have me there, whether to just say hi or let me know what you think of this train-of-thought nonsense.</p>                        </article>
