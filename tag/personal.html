<h2 id="blog">blog</h2>
<p>Oh I forgot to mention earlier:</p>
<p>I fixed pagination on my blog so that's good. The posts in hidden section still shows up on pages that aren't the first page, but that should be an easy enough fix. Basically, for some reason the <code>index.html</code> source included two pagination starters, so literally all I had to do was delete one of them. I also changed the pagination template itself so look a little nicer -- I changed it from being a vertical <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code> object with entries for first, prev, cur, next, and last to cramming all five of those things into a single row. I think it looks nice.</p>
<p>I do also need to still see if it's paginating at the right <em>count</em> of posts, but I haven't bothered counting the posts.</p>
<p>I also just thought of a cute little idea to do: Right now it's a little awkward when I push a new Blog post and a new Tech post because they end up fighting for the front page and people can easily miss one because they only expect one update a day. Maybe I can adjust my theme to show the most recent of both posts? Perhaps a little side menu that floats along the left of the main post body that lets you select which one to view. I made a quick <code>draw.io</code> example below:</p>
<p><span class="center-span">
<img alt="A post from this blog. A small sub-menu floats to the left of the post, with the entry &quot;Blog&quot; highlighted. Below it is the entry &quot;Tech&quot;. Both entries have an 'updated on' date." src="/imgs/blogconcept_sectionselector.png">
<em>Having it float would be a pain in the ass, and I'll have to get very comfortable with css, but it could be neat.</em>
</span></p>
<h2 id="ffxiv">ffxiv</h2>
<p>I'm doing better in FFXIV again. I think I've just been sleep deprived and now that I'm catching back up a little bit the mechanics are settling in my head a hell of a lot easier. I'm finding a lot of little mechanic concept shortcuts I should have found earlier that make it a lot less difficult to think about.</p>
<h2 id="bbcf">bbcf</h2>
<p>Only a small comment, otherwise I'd make it a new post as usual. My playstyle <em>really</em> suits playing Jin and I don't know how to feel about that. Looking back at some of my games, sure I'm making the usual mistakes I do on Terumi, but they work out a lot better because of Jin's kit -- and in fact, sometimes are <em>really good</em> strategies for Jin. So I don't know how I feel about that. I'm definitely going to keep Jin as a sub-character, but if a single person tells me that my Jin is better than my Terumi I'm actually going to walk into the ocean to never be seen again. I'll find all the tea we threw into the harbor forever ago.</p>
<p><em>(Author's note: Yeah. They got told that Jin is extremely fitted to their playstyle and are dealing with the emotional ramifications of that. There's a surprising amount of green tea down here at the bottom of the harbor, did you know?)</em></p>
<p>Have this silly little meme I made after I did a <code>2a -&gt; 2a -&gt; 66 -&gt; 312C</code> and it caught someone trying to jump out of my jab pressure. I literally made it at 12:40 am.</p>
<p><span class="center-span">
