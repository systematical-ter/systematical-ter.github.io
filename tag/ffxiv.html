</footer><!-- /.post-info --><p>So... A lot has happened in the past few days. I won't necessarily talk about all of it here, first off because my family has the superstition that talking about things before they happen is very bad luck, and second off because I still kind of want to keep BBCF talk in the BBCF notes section. I'll make a post about the first thing if/when it gets confirmed for certain.</p>
<p>The thing I <em>can</em> talk about is my early presentation of my thesis went well, and I think that was overall good because it made me get a clear picture of the work I've done in the past year and now it shouldn't be too hard to write its chapter in my thesis and submit it as a poster somewhere.</p>
<p>I'm taking today as a slow day after the emotional roller coaster of the past two-ish weeks. Going to see if I can't do some household things and (calmly) work on some of the work I've been behind on. I'm also going to maybe go out to eat to celebrate the thing I can't talk about yet, since I know there's a burger place near me that doesn't mind people pulling out their laptops and working at the bar during lunchtime. My arthritis is kicking my ass again so I don't know how much I'll want to get out of the house even for good food, though.</p>
<p>I've said this before, but hopefully I'll edit this at the end of the day with more interesting things. I'm hoping to get a little more work done on my sprite tool, now that I'm not in do or die mode.</p>
<h2 id="tech-things">Tech Things</h2>
<p>Nice, my blog pagination finally broke! I'll try to fix that tonight.</p>
<p>Oh, 5 hours later I've thought of something to talk about!</p>
<h3 id="audio-nonsense">Audio Nonsense</h3>
<p>So I have a funny little problem. I might have mentioned it before, but I honestly don't remember. I have pretty bad audio processing issues, so I generally have BBCF at 20% volume in-game and 4% volume through the Windows mixer. That's what I gotta do in order to hear Discord chat over the game, and for the in-game sfx to not feel like it's blowing out my eardrums. This is normally fine, except I've been trying to record + stream lately.</p>
<p>So what ends up happening is, I have to set everything to 60%-ish on the capture in OBS while leaving BBCF at max volume. This ends up making my entire stream pretty damn quiet compared to most streams. More annoyingly, every time I record something, it ends up so quiet that I not only have to boost the entire bus by 200%, I have to ALSO boost the audio track itself by 150% for it to even hold a candle to normal youtube videos.</p>
<p>I took some time yesterday to try and figure out a way around it. What I want is as follows:</p>
<p>I want BBCF to export to 2 separate audio outputs. One is captured by OBS, and one is sent to by headphones. To my headphones, I want it to be at 20%, while to OBS, I want to leave it at 100%.</p>
<p>It looks like this is nearly impossible??</p>
<p>I've downloaded Voicemeter Banana, and while I can point BBCF to output to a virtual output(?) device that I can then point to my headphones alongside everything else, it seems like I'm still going to have to turn down the virtual output itself in vmb, and if I do that, I believe OBS will also capture the volume-down version. So... It doesn't actually help.</p>
<p>I spoke to a friend about it, and it's beginning to seem like I'm at the point where I'll need actual hardware to do this sort of volume control. I do know someone else I could talk to, but I might just ask them in person next sort-of monthly instead of pestering them on discord.</p>
<h2 id="ffxiv">FFXIV</h2>
<p>I'm being forced (joking) to return to FFXIV because I promised my raid group I'd still be around for next tier. And, to be honest, it's probably good for me to step back away from my intense 4 month hyperfocus with BBCF and do something else sometimes.</p>
<p>I'm still 2 patches behind of current content since the last patch came out when I'd already gone on hiatus. I'll deal with that at some point, but for now I've just unlocked the new raid since that's what I'm here for. I've also gone and updated my glamour to match my Terumi palette a little better, so enjoy this silly little portrait of it. I'm not a huge gposer, so I'm not the best at taking photos.</p>

</span></p>
<p>Going to be doing this raid as a VIP (hopefully), and my goal right now is to just get my crafter and gatherer gear up to the point where I can craft food/pots for the group.</p>
<p>Fun fact! This is why my comment in random places is "Hi I'm Glit". My username in MMOs has been some variation of Glit Gagarin ever since 2014-ish.</p>                    </article>
