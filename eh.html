<p>I played some UNI2 challenge mode, got up to Expert 17, I think? Looking forward to actually playing that game at some point. Gordeau's fun but I get the feeling I'm going to get hit in the mouth for depending on his C moves too much in neutral.</p>
<p>I need to pick up a secondary on BBCF at some point; I feel bad showing up to chill streams or lobbies with Terumi and my nearly 4k games because I look like a tryhard spoiling the fun (even though my tryhard is still way below many people's casual play.) I did get a good 40 games in on Hazama today and I think I'm <em>starting</em> to properly understand him. Definitely not even close to being playable, but I've started being faster about my stance mix and started to actually move around with my chains. Need to remember that regular, non-stance pressure is a thing and to remember the post-launcher part of my combos.</p>
<p>There'll probably be something more technical tomorrow. Brain no work good today.</p>
