</footer><!-- /.post-info --><p>I'm pretty sure I mentioned a while back about my time-blindness. Well, have a great example! How the <em>hell</em> has it been almost 2 months since I last made a blog post? Just gonna make a small post to prove to myself that this blog isn't dead.</p>
<p>Anyways, a lot is still happening. Travel upon travel upon flights delayed by 6 hours into attending my first regional. It was fun! I got to TO! I hung out with some super awesome people! I went 0-2... But I'll deal with that. Done with that crashout, no use to crash out again.</p>
<h3 id="replay-processing">Replay Processing</h3>
<p>Going to be picking back up my replay project. Talking about it to someone reminded me that it exists and I think it'd be fun to work on again. There's two major things I still want to work on:</p>
<ol>
<li>The UI.</li>
<li>Processing inputs, too.</li>
</ol>
<p>Part 1 is important because right now I am up to over 130 folders of backed up BBCF save folders (containing replays + replay_list files) and I'd like to be able to actually look through them effectively to pull out specific replays I want to re-watch. Actually progressing on this project on the UI front will enable me to do that.</p>
<p>Part 2 is interesting because part of the whole point of this project is I wanted to be able to control whether or not the players skipped the intro sequence. I haven't been able to figure it out from the binary itself yet, so maybe it'll help if I actually parse the binary into XInput inputs. (My guess is some value represents the "start processing" offset, and turning the XInput inputs into actual objects will help determine which of those values it is.)</p>
<h3 id="sprite-recolor">Sprite Recolor</h3>
<p>I do also want to continue my spriterecolor project, but that's lower priority because it completely exploded out of scope. First thing I do before I even start considering it is figure out whether I want to rewrite it in C# or bite the bullet and just make UI in Python. (Which might not be a bad thing to learn anyways.)</p>
<p>I've also learned a lot about making packages in python since starting my sprite recolor project, so I might want to refactor the whole thing (again) anyways.</p>                        </article>
