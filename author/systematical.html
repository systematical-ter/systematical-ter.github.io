</footer><!-- /.post-info --><p>Not a great BBCF day, to be honest. Was probably a bad idea to play while still being murdered by arthritis. Got advice, fought some even matches, got obliterated by a Jin/Hakumen after they finished warming up. Would love to get more matches with them, but I won't put their name here so SEO doesn't air out my dirty laundry, because when I search them I only see Ghost's VOD vs their Ragna.</p>
<h2>TL;DR :</h2>
<p>Work on 66bb, 9bb, 96, and 6a jc confirm.</p>
<h2>Full Notes :</h2>
<p>Some notes from those matches:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hakumen thrives on predictable stagger. Either keep things tight or keep things intentionally not tight to catch him on his counter's recovery.</li>
<li>Try to mix up high/lows if I am being predictable in my stagger so he has to choose between countering high or countering low.</li>
<li>Watch today's saved replays from that Jin/Hakumen.</li>
</ul>
<p>Other thoughts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Still need to get better at 6a.</li>
<li>Practice immediately jump cancelling into the air combo. I'm losing too much by defaulting to 2D and whiffing.</li>
<li>Still also practice 6a into [6]b to have it if I ever have the reaction to realize I've counterhit without expecting it.</li>
<li>Lab out better expected 6a CH combos with 2D. My [6]b combo shouldn't be doing more damage than it.</li>
<li>Practice 6C -&gt; 22CCCC -&gt; OD -&gt; 66D -&gt; 6321466D . I shouldn't be dropping it this often and it's VERY important.</li>
<li>Practice microdash 2c or just straight up 2c instead of trying to microdash 2a all the time.</li>
<li>Watch more DGF/Zander and see how they do oki. I'm still not timing my (hit) -&gt; 6C -&gt; 236D (whiff) right. I'm getting either mashed out or grab countered, which is besides the whole point.</li>
<li>Zander said my pressure is still linear. Keep an eye on my habits when I make my compilation video to see if I can spot it. (Already I know I have the habit of doing a low -&gt; 2 mids -&gt; high ; the hakumen beat the shit out of me for it.)</li>
</ul>
<p>Things I gotta just grind out in practice mode:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dash barrier block.</li>
<li>In the corner: 9 jump with immediate BB.</li>
<li>96 dash. I keep doing 766 which is way way way too predictable.</li>
</ul>
<p>... Yeah I definitely need to cut down this list and pick one particular thing to worry about. Executive decision: Ignore the Hakumen-specific MU notes, and instead focus on my movement (66 bb, 9bb, 96) and 6A usage.</p>

<p>I have a blog now, and that's pretty neat! It's made using <a href="https://getpelican.com/">Pelican</a>, and I have a script that takes my (private) source repository, compiles it, and pushes the output to the (public) repository that actually gets automatically made into a github pages website. That part was all fine and dandy!</p>
<h2>Using Visual Editors</h2>
<p>I decided to make life difficult for myself, though, and wanted to be able to edit the content using <a href="https://obsidian.md/">Obsidian</a>, a little application I use when I need to write a lot of markdown files for notes or a guide or something. That was a little bit annoying, because I do my python coding in WSL, so the repository containing my blog <code>.md</code> is on the WSL file system. Trying to just point the windows Obsidian install to that folder caused a bunch of file read errors, so I went ahead and installed Obsidian on WSL itself.</p>
<p>I downloaded the <code>.deb</code> file, installed it, and then futzed around making it so my WSL2 install could actually run visual applications (because what's the point of all of this if I can't run linux visual apps, right?) Turns out I had to run a quick:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="k">export</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">DISPLAY</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="mi">0</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>... and it magically started working. Neat! (I probably have to do this every time I start a new terminal until I figure out where it's setting <code>$DISPLAY</code> to anything else.)</p>
<p>... And it was at this point I realized... I could probably just use VSCode instead. Oh well! I'll probably just use that next time and nuke Obsidian off my WSL, since it keeps trying to make folders in my root directory and I don't want it to do that.</p>
<h2>Life Updates</h2>
<p>Arthritis is a solid 4/10 today. Better than yesterday's 6/10, but not great. I got a thumbs up from my hematologist to use Aleve at most once or twice a week with my low dose of blood thinners, but I don't really want to fuck with it too much so I'll just grit and deal with it for today until my rheumatologist gets back to me about other options. I'm glad I found a heatpack.</p>
<p>One of my classmates came to the office today with Mono, so that was... annoying. (Context: I am immune compromised, and I get sick at the slightest provocation and stay sick for weeks.) I have an interview scheduled in a week, a semi-monthly to go to, and two thesis chapters to write, so I don't need that shit in my life right now. I put on a mask but then quickly peaced out after saying hi to a collaborator that was visiting.</p>
<p>(Still blows my mind that people think that's just... okay. Even if I wasn't immune compromised, why make other people sick? Anyways, I'm too close to getting myself into a tizzy, so I'm leaving the rant there for now.)</p>
<h2>Fun things</h2>
<p>I have a few things in mind to make creatively:</p>
<p><strong>"I do not control the rate at which lobsters die", but with a twist: "I do not control the rate at which <em>I lock in</em>", especially accurate after I completely locked myself out yesterday.</strong></p>
<p>I was too hype? excited? confused? about the fact there was finally a Terumi (and it was Zander, nonetheless!) in a bracket I watched... only for it to be a mirror match I was playing in on stream... to lock in. I played real bad, dropped a really easy combo to take my possibly only round, but thankfully none of the existential self-doubt set in. Plus, I had some fun casuals with him after so that was a positive note to end on.</p>
<p><strong>A proper Terumi keychain.</strong></p>
<p>I made my silly little emote one, but I still have one that's 90% finished I should actually finish, and I want to make a not-chibi version at some point because believe it or not, I actually really don't like chibi art. It's just what is fast enough to do so I actually finish it.</p>
<p><strong>My next match compilation video.</strong></p>
<p>I accidentally put off making my next one for a WHOLE MONTH, so now I have 60 matches to watch to cherry pick into only the best 30 mins of footage. Even at only 3 minutes per match, that's <em>three hours</em> of watch time... I might have to watch them at 2x speed. Plus I always feel bad about picking only wins, so I have some weird standard of "interesting-ness" I'm basing my choice of matches on instead that really slows the whole process down.</p>
<p><strong>More emotes.</strong></p>
<p>I don't have specific plans yet, but I'm happy that I finally have some twitch emotes. Now I gotta make a few more so I can start using them in random places. (That reminds me that I need to add that Pelican module that lets you use custom emoji so I can throw them in here too.)</p>
<h2>Bye-bye now!</h2>
<p>(Insert Gin Ichimaru clip here.)</p>
<p>You can find me on bluesky <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/systematical.bsky.social">here</a> and on youtube <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNJoOANdZSmxZA2m-D5aTBQ">here</a> and on twitch <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/systematical">here</a>. Some day I'll finish branding all of these various places. 'Til I get comments or whatever set up on this blog -- if I do so at all -- feel free to send me a message on bluesky or Discord if you have me there, whether to just say hi or let me know what you think of this train-of-thought nonsense.</p>                        </article>
