</footer><!-- /.post-info --><p>It was mostly a fine BBCF day at first? TMN was fine. </p>
<p>Heads up that this is a little bit emo so feel free to skip to a section or whatever if you want. Just need to get this off my chest, and if I can't write about it in my personal blog, what the fuck's the point of this blog?</p>
<p>I got some good practice matches in with Augo, and I think I actually really like the Kagura matchup even though I think it's Kagura-favored. It's explosive, and that's kind of fun.</p>
<p>I almost took my first set today. Would have been neat, but I didn't respect Bullet's drives enough.</p>
<p>I could have won my second set but I didn't respect the size of Es' buttons. That bothered me a little because again I lost something I should've won but I turned off my brain and ran into stuff.</p>
<p>Biggest issue is I looked at the seeding afterwards. No offense to the person I was seeded below, they're a great person and I'm sure they're going to do great as they keep playing. They'll undoubtedly outpace me, but like... it sure was something to see myself seeded below them when I've literally been on their stream and beat the everliving crud against them before.</p>
<p>Kind of sent me a little bit into a crisis of faith because like... what's the point? I apparently never impress anybody and at this rate I'm never going to be given the chance to. Like, fuck, man. I thought I was finally making some moves, even despite arthritis locking up my joints like no tomorrow, even despite showing everyone how much I was absolute trash by trying to connect to people when I first started playing. I started playing <em>fighting games as a whole</em> last fall, and I've gotten this far. Yet I'm still placed below people that I thought I proved I could beat because that's where people think I belong. </p>
<p>But whatever.</p>
<p>That's not why I play this game, I play it cus it's fun. And I can see myself getting better, it doesn't matter if people I know don't think I am, I guess. I shouldn't be taking all this shit personally anyways cus the TO's got enough going on, they don't have to deal with me being a dramatic bitch too.</p>
<p>Plus I need to not forget, there are people I know who have very explicitly told me that I'm improving and they can see it. Need to make my shitty brain shut up and remember that just because some people don't see it, doesn't mean it's not true. There are people who do see it.</p>
<p>Fuzz showed up in my lobby today. Kinda wish I could have gotten a game in with him, little bit of a "senpai notice me" kinda deal since his Hazama is fucking amazing. He doesn't tag me in his Terumi posts on NOL so he probably still doesn't know who I am. Not gonna reach out to him because why would he give me the time of day. I'd just embarass myself anyways. Same deal with DGF. Would love to fight him and see his Terumi in a game, but I'm not gonna bother him. I'm glad I at least have contact with Zander so I'm not afraid to reach out to him occasionally.</p>
<p>My usual sparring buddy (can I call him that at this point? idk) of course has a great Terumi, we're just.. definitely too used to playing eachother at this point with how much bullshit we do only works because it's the particular person we're playing. (s/o to the fact we both IAD grab round start multiple times a set.) Got lotta games in with him today. He beat my ass as usual, but I got the chance to get some 6a practice in and I took a few matches despite being an emotional and physical wreck.</p>
<h2>Notes</h2>
<p>6a progress is going not bad. I'm using it now. I'm able to confirm it with both 2D and a jc j.c, but now I need to work on getting the [6]b confirm out.</p>
<p>Still need to work on movement. Copied from yesterday's:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dash barrier block.</li>
<li>In the corner: 9 jump with immediate BB.</li>
<li>96 dash. I keep doing 766 which is way way way too predictable.</li>
</ul>
<p>Also I've lost some combos, somehow.</p>
<ul>
<li>Stop fucking up my 4d j.b j.c jc j.c j.2d combo.</li>
<li>Need to get 6c -&gt; 22cccc -&gt; OD -&gt; 66d -&gt; 6321466d consistent again.</li>
</ul>
<p>I randomly started getting better at bullshitting combos, though. Landed some nice freestyles today, so I might be actually learning how moves go into each other.</p>
<p>Not many other notes today. I'm sure I can find something but this is plenty to work on for now so no reason to. Maybe I'll find something when I go back over my vods.</p>                        </article>

</footer><!-- /.post-info --><p>Arthritis is still at a 4/10 today. Maybe even creeping back up to a 6/10 the more I sit with it. I'm hoping it doesn't affect my TMN run too badly. Even though I'm not much better yet, it's really amusing to look back at things I've done while distracted by pain, as I just had to read an error message that <em>I</em> wrote that said: "sprited requeste". I think my arthritis might be visible today, because when I went to a local coffee shop they brought my sandwich to me, which is a first. Either way, it was extremely nice of them and I appreciate it.</p>
<h3>UPDATE (from later in the day) :</h3>
<p>Got new pain meds from my rheumatologist. They still have increased bleeding risk, but since my hematologist recommended it and my rheumatologist approved it, I figure it should be safe enough. I just need to make sure to listen to the "take with food" and "no alcohol" warnings. Here's hoping it works, because today has been... a day. I'm sure I'll make a long-winded post to provide context some day.</p>
<h2>Tech Talk</h2>
<p>So I reached an interesting conundrum with my pixel manipulation code.</p>
<p>This entire time I've been operating off the assumption that the <code>.png</code> files were sort of -- how to put this -- main attraction? As in, I make <code>Sprite</code> objects based off the <code>.png</code> files and then augment the <code>Sprite</code> objects with collision metadata after the fact.</p>
<p>But that's not really how it works. Obviously, there isn't really a straight-forward way for them to link <code>.png</code>s to collision metadata in the image's <code>.png</code> (or if there is, it was lost in decompilation). Rather, the collision metadata is aware of the images, so really the collision metadata should be the main attraction.</p>
<p>From just the collision metadata, I can get all of the information needed for a complete sprite. I can't do that from an image, so theoretically, if I ever plan to read in collision metadata, I should start there.</p>
<p>I think I'll refactor my code logic (again). Instead of allowing someone to create a <code>Sprite</code> object and then augment it with metadata, which requires deconvoluting which metadata associates with which existing created <code>Sprite</code> object, I'll make it so if you ever plan to contain collision metadata, you start there and that gives the script the knowledge of where to get the image.</p>
<p>This helps too with some of the weirder collision metadatas. Like, there's one called something about a knife? That one broke a lot of my sorting code, but I'm certain that if I want to implement move export based on character script logic, I'll have to handle cases like that one sooner than later.</p>
<p>I'm also currently working under the assumption that metadata files only ever have 1 image file associated with them, which I need to check. My guess is I'll find exceptions with characters like Relius or Celica.</p>
<h3>UPDATE (from later in the day):</h3>
<p>I've refactored everything so that now you can either create <code>Sprite</code> objects from just images and add the metadata later, or you start with the collision metadata and it loads the image too when creating the <code>Sprite</code> object. Overall I'm happy with how the code works now, since I think it's fairly straightforward to run it from the command line, from another python script to simply combine gifs, and from another python script to both recolor and turn into a gif in a single go.</p>
<p>You can see the scripts on my github, <a href="https://github.com/systematical-ter/sprite-mgmt">here</a>. If you feel like trying it out, be my guest!</p>
<p>I still have 2 major features to add:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Add support for spawned entities. (For example, the sneks in Terumi's j.D). It's going to be a little bit annoying because I have to figure out when to start <em>their</em> animation. This information is stored in the character's script file, but that means I need to work on parsing the script files to figure out when that is. I'll add a post about why that's complicated soon-ish.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add the capability to generate a gif from a move, and a UI to do so. The UI is kind of necessary because of the complexity of parsing a character's script file, which like I said in part 1, I'll talk about some other time.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I also want to go back and adjust <code>spriterecolor.py</code> to use these <code>Sprite</code> objects. Right now it's kind of janky to do the whole shebang of recolor -&gt; gif, and I don't like it. It'll be a lot neater if I can put the sprite name next to the <code>Image</code>, and putting it into a <code>Sprite</code> will take care of that.</p>
<p>I also still eventually need to support base palettes, so if someone shows up who wants to use one it won't be a huge pain in the ass.</p>
<h2>Random Things of Interest</h2>
<p>Someone in the US is selling the Hazama figure at JP (minus shipping) prices <a href="https://myfigurecollection.net/classified/395824">here</a>, so that's kind of neat. If I had $350-ish to spend, I probably would have reached out to them and seen if I can barter them down a tiny bit, but as it stands now I'm a grad candidate so I need to save that money for possibly having to relocate and buy a car. (Plus also, it's not Terumi /complain complain)</p>
<p>Along that vein, someone's selling a bag back from the bbcf x supergroupies collab <a href="https://zenmarket.jp/en/othershopproduct.aspx?u=https%3a%2f%2fwww.suruga-ya.jp%2fproduct%2fdetail%2f608698984">here</a>. It's Hazama themed and honestly kind of neat, but again, I can't really excuse buying it right now, especially since shipping will probably be another $40. Maybe if I could bring it down to $110 USD but I don't think it's common to barter in japanese culture, nor do I have any means to since I don't speak japanese and no proxy service offers bartering.</p>                        </article>

</footer><!-- /.post-info --><p>Not a great BBCF day, to be honest. Was probably a bad idea to play while still being murdered by arthritis. Got advice, fought some even matches, got obliterated by a Jin/Hakumen after they finished warming up. Would love to get more matches with them, but I won't put their name here so SEO doesn't air out my dirty laundry, because when I search them I only see Ghost's VOD vs their Ragna.</p>
<h2>TL;DR :</h2>
<p>Work on 66bb, 9bb, 96, and 6a jc confirm.</p>
<h2>Full Notes :</h2>
<p>Some notes from those matches:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hakumen thrives on predictable stagger. Either keep things tight or keep things intentionally not tight to catch him on his counter's recovery.</li>
<li>Try to mix up high/lows if I am being predictable in my stagger so he has to choose between countering high or countering low.</li>
<li>Watch today's saved replays from that Jin/Hakumen.</li>
</ul>
<p>Other thoughts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Still need to get better at 6a.</li>
<li>Practice immediately jump cancelling into the air combo. I'm losing too much by defaulting to 2D and whiffing.</li>
<li>Still also practice 6a into [6]b to have it if I ever have the reaction to realize I've counterhit without expecting it.</li>
<li>Lab out better expected 6a CH combos with 2D. My [6]b combo shouldn't be doing more damage than it.</li>
<li>Practice 6C -&gt; 22CCCC -&gt; OD -&gt; 66D -&gt; 6321466D . I shouldn't be dropping it this often and it's VERY important.</li>
<li>Practice microdash 2c or just straight up 2c instead of trying to microdash 2a all the time.</li>
<li>Watch more DGF/Zander and see how they do oki. I'm still not timing my (hit) -&gt; 6C -&gt; 236D (whiff) right. I'm getting either mashed out or grab countered, which is besides the whole point.</li>
<li>Zander said my pressure is still linear. Keep an eye on my habits when I make my compilation video to see if I can spot it. (Already I know I have the habit of doing a low -&gt; 2 mids -&gt; high ; the hakumen beat the shit out of me for it.)</li>
</ul>
<p>Things I gotta just grind out in practice mode:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dash barrier block.</li>
<li>In the corner: 9 jump with immediate BB.</li>
<li>96 dash. I keep doing 766 which is way way way too predictable.</li>
</ul>
<p>... Yeah I definitely need to cut down this list and pick one particular thing to worry about. Executive decision: Ignore the Hakumen-specific MU notes, and instead focus on my movement (66 bb, 9bb, 96) and 6A usage.</p>

</footer><!-- /.post-info --><p>So....</p>
<p>I have a blog now, and that's pretty neat! It's made using <a href="https://getpelican.com/">Pelican</a>, and I have a script that takes my (private) source repository, compiles it, and pushes the output to the (public) repository that actually gets automatically made into a github pages website. That part was all fine and dandy!</p>
<h2>Using Visual Editors</h2>
<p>I decided to make life difficult for myself, though, and wanted to be able to edit the content using <a href="https://obsidian.md/">Obsidian</a>, a little application I use when I need to write a lot of markdown files for notes or a guide or something. That was a little bit annoying, because I do my python coding in WSL, so the repository containing my blog <code>.md</code> is on the WSL file system. Trying to just point the windows Obsidian install to that folder caused a bunch of file read errors, so I went ahead and installed Obsidian on WSL itself.</p>
<p>I downloaded the <code>.deb</code> file, installed it, and then futzed around making it so my WSL2 install could actually run visual applications (because what's the point of all of this if I can't run linux visual apps, right?) Turns out I had to run a quick:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="k">export</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">DISPLAY</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="mi">0</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>... and it magically started working. Neat! (I probably have to do this every time I start a new terminal until I figure out where it's setting <code>$DISPLAY</code> to anything else.)</p>
<p>... And it was at this point I realized... I could probably just use VSCode instead. Oh well! I'll probably just use that next time and nuke Obsidian off my WSL, since it keeps trying to make folders in my root directory and I don't want it to do that.</p>
<h2>Life Updates</h2>
<p>Arthritis is a solid 4/10 today. Better than yesterday's 6/10, but not great. I got a thumbs up from my hematologist to use Aleve at most once or twice a week with my low dose of blood thinners, but I don't really want to fuck with it too much so I'll just grit and deal with it for today until my rheumatologist gets back to me about other options. I'm glad I found a heatpack.</p>
<p>One of my classmates came to the office today with Mono, so that was... annoying. (Context: I am immune compromised, and I get sick at the slightest provocation and stay sick for weeks.) I have an interview scheduled in a week, a semi-monthly to go to, and two thesis chapters to write, so I don't need that shit in my life right now. I put on a mask but then quickly peaced out after saying hi to a collaborator that was visiting.</p>
<p>(Still blows my mind that people think that's just... okay. Even if I wasn't immune compromised, why make other people sick? Anyways, I'm too close to getting myself into a tizzy, so I'm leaving the rant there for now.)</p>
<h2>Fun things</h2>
<p>I have a few things in mind to make creatively:</p>
<p><strong>"I do not control the rate at which lobsters die", but with a twist: "I do not control the rate at which <em>I lock in</em>", especially accurate after I completely locked myself out yesterday.</strong></p>
<p>I was too hype? excited? confused? about the fact there was finally a Terumi (and it was Zander, nonetheless!) in a bracket I watched... only for it to be a mirror match I was playing in on stream... to lock in. I played real bad, dropped a really easy combo to take my possibly only round, but thankfully none of the existential self-doubt set in. Plus, I had some fun casuals with him after so that was a positive note to end on.</p>
<p><strong>A proper Terumi keychain.</strong></p>
<p>I made my silly little emote one, but I still have one that's 90% finished I should actually finish, and I want to make a not-chibi version at some point because believe it or not, I actually really don't like chibi art. It's just what is fast enough to do so I actually finish it.</p>
<p><strong>My next match compilation video.</strong></p>
<p>I accidentally put off making my next one for a WHOLE MONTH, so now I have 60 matches to watch to cherry pick into only the best 30 mins of footage. Even at only 3 minutes per match, that's <em>three hours</em> of watch time... I might have to watch them at 2x speed. Plus I always feel bad about picking only wins, so I have some weird standard of "interesting-ness" I'm basing my choice of matches on instead that really slows the whole process down.</p>
<p><strong>More emotes.</strong></p>
<p>I don't have specific plans yet, but I'm happy that I finally have some twitch emotes. Now I gotta make a few more so I can start using them in random places. (That reminds me that I need to add that Pelican module that lets you use custom emoji so I can throw them in here too.)</p>
<h2>Bye-bye now!</h2>
<p>(Insert Gin Ichimaru clip here.)</p>
<p>You can find me on bluesky <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/systematical.bsky.social">here</a> and on youtube <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNJoOANdZSmxZA2m-D5aTBQ">here</a> and on twitch <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/systematical">here</a>.

'Til I get comments or whatever set up on this blog -- if I do so at all -- feel free to send me a message on bluesky or Discord if you have me there, whether to just say hi or let me know what you think of this train-of-thought nonsense.</p>                        </article>
