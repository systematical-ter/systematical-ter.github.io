</footer><!-- /.post-info -->        <p>Nah nah nah today wasn't it for BBCF. TRO went very fast, I got obliterated by two very good players. First match vs Taokaka I know it was a thinking speed (+MU knowledge) gap, second match vs Ragna I have no idea what happened. I'll need to VOD review that one, but I think it was just flat out a normals gap and I took too many risky chances because I was lost and confused.</p>
<p>Had random matches as usual. Fought 2 hakumens in ranked, which in combination with the hakumen from the 11th is a fighteningly large percentage of hakumens?? It's just a little funny considering I was just talking about how I have no idea how to fight hakumen. Got some good exp even though I wasn't trying to focus on the matchup.</p>
<p>Also had a fascinating thing happen. I got invited to a game and then told, basically, that they didn't realize I was the Systematical the Terumi player.</p>
<p>Which... kind of implies that people actually know of <em>Systematical</em> the <em>Terumi player</em>? Which like yeah, okay, this is a fairly small community and I think I host rooms fairly often. But uh. Wow. That's never happened in all of my years of FFXIV despite regularly leading pug extreme groups and topping the damage meters. It that only happened in Wildstar because by the end of its lifespan it was like, the same 40 people being passed between raid groups. Hell, people forget who I am in person all the time -- it's part of the reason I started dying my hair green, so maybe I'd be a little more recognizeable. (Spoiler: it didn't work.)</p>
<p>I still remember when I would show up to people's BBCF streams and they'd usually be like "who are you again?" or outright ignore me, but today someone in a chat actually went out of their way to say that they saw my BBBO performance and to say good job.</p>
<p>I know I just got over the whole thing about I shouldn't care what other people think about my performance, etc etc, but this is a little different, I guess? Cus it's not really about <em>what</em> they think about Systematical the Terumi player. People show up to my rooms and give me full sets and that's all I really ask for.</p>
<p>It's just, like, huh.</p>
<p>People actually know who I am now.</p>
<p>That's a strange feeling.</p>
<p>(I really didn't think I'd get this far?)</p>
<h2 id="to-work-on">To work on</h2>
<p>I've been getting impatient on defense. Gonna try to cut that down a bit. Even thinking back to my BBBO run, Aerodat was telling me that I gotta not mash at certain points. Not sure how to get out of Terumi pressure otherwise, so I need to see where people are mashing out of my pressure. </p>
<p>My defense is actually <em>really</em> not bad. In my random matches with my buddy today, I blocked some whack ass fucking mixups while still being able to watch <em>his</em> character to see when he did something unsafe, and I actually managed to hit him during his overhead start up. I was even starting to block some of Tao's whackiness during the tourney -- with some better experience in the MU, I really could have put up a fight, which against <em>that</em> player? That's fucking <em>hype</em>.</p>
<p>I think I also need to work on j.2D'ing as fast as possible, I went in a match vs a certain other Terumi today and the speed at which he did that shit was absurd.</p>
<p>I think the things I added to my docket of things to practice today were:</p>
<ul>
<li>j.2D as fast as possible</li>
<li>236D/[6]b to move around</li>
</ul>
<p>I also realized a huge glaring hole today. There were <em>many</em> times in random matches where I <em>could</em> have won, but I was just short on damage. I think now's a good time to sit down and look at some better combos.</p>
<p>Also, pretend I copy-pasted the movement list here. Of course still gotta work on that, but I know that's going to be something that takes a long time.</p>
<p>Toodoo-loo.</p>
<p>Also hey if you actually read this, feel free to let me know. This is more personal than I usually post online so I'm curious if anyone actually reads it.</p>
