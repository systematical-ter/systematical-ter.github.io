<p>Burned myself out on blazblue again, went really hard for two days and then started going down the mental void again and now I hate how I play and hate how I try but still suck hate that I just can't connect with most of the community for some reason and etc etc but that's enough of that. Just gonna try not to play for a few days and see if it goes away. Maybe do some video editing since I have some awesome matches I want to collect, but I'm worried that'll make me think too much about blazblue and not help.</p>
<p><em>(Author's note: they did still end up playing Blazblue, because they are a pushover and if friends vaguely suggest that they want to play with them, they fold instantly. But they were still upset at themselves and played Jin instead of Terumi to try to keep it casual.)</em></p>
<p>Two weeks left to have my thesis done and sent to my committee for review. God it's hard to write. Then I defend, and then it's just dotting is, crossing ts, and finishing up my work for the people funding this year of my phd.</p>
<p>I'm doing poorly in ffxiv too. The rust is showing. I'm dying to mechanics I shouldn't be dying to and not being the cornerstone of the group I used to be. Expected, but I still feel bad.</p>
<h2 id="content-creator-stuff">Content Creator Stuff</h2>
<p>Figured might as well make a section. I put up VODs of my tournament runs, 6 and 4 views respectively. Not surprised, I should really stop putting them as unlisted but idk. I feel awkward putting games up with people's names on them without asking if that's OK first, but I get the feeling it's awkward to ask and I'm just being an outsider.</p>
<p>Going to try and make an icon for my twitch channel + youtube at least. People keep being surprised when I tell them I've had a twitch channel since like, 2014. And have had affiliate since 2019. And right now even though I'm uploading stuff to youtube I think people still assume I don't do anything because I have the default icon. I'd just commission one or use a terumi sprite, but I feel like it's gotta be something I drew myself because it's supposed to be a representation of <em>me</em>, y'know? I have a sketch done, just gotta actually follow through on it.</p>
