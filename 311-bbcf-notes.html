</footer><!-- /.post-info -->        <p>Not a great BBCF day, to be honest. Was probably a bad idea to play while still being murdered by arthritis. Got advice, fought some even matches, got obliterated by a Jin/Hakumen after they finished warming up. Would love to get more matches with them, but I won't put their name here so SEO doesn't air out my dirty laundry, because when I search them I only see Ghost's VOD vs their Ragna.</p>
<p>Some notes from those matches:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hakumen thrives on predictable stagger. Either keep things tight or keep things intentionally not tight to catch him on his counter's recovery.</li>
<li>Try to mix up high/lows if I am being predictable in my stagger so he has to choose between countering high or countering low.</li>
<li>Watch today's saved replays from that Jin/Hakumen.</li>
</ul>
<p>Other thoughts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Still need to get better at 6a.</li>
<li>Practice immediately jump cancelling into the air combo. I'm losing too much by defaulting to 2D and whiffing.</li>
<li>Still also practice 6a into [6]b to have it if I ever have the reaction to realize I've counterhit without expecting it.</li>
<li>Lab out better expected 6a CH combos with 2D. My [6]b combo shouldn't be doing more damage than it.</li>
<li>Practice 6C -&gt; 22CCCC -&gt; OD -&gt; 66D -&gt; 6321466D . I shouldn't be dropping it this often and it's VERY important.</li>
<li>Practice microdash 2c or just straight up 2c instead of trying to microdash 2a all the time.</li>
<li>Watch more DGF/Zander and see how they do oki. I'm still not timing my (hit) -&gt; 6C -&gt; 236D (whiff) right. I'm getting either mashed out or grab countered, which is besides the whole point.</li>
<li>Zander said my pressure is still linear. Keep an eye on my habits when I make my compilation video to see if I can spot it. (Already I know I have the habit of doing a low -&gt; 2 mids -&gt; high ; the hakumen beat the shit out of me for it.)</li>
</ul>
<p>Things I gotta just grind out in practice mode:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dash barrier block.</li>
<li>In the corner: 9 jump with immediate BB.</li>
<li>96 dash. I keep doing 766 which is way way way too predictable.</li>
</ul>
<p>... Yeah I definitely need to cut down this list and pick one particular thing to worry about. Executive decision: Ignore the Hakumen-specific MU notes, and instead focus on my movement (66 bb, 9bb, 96) and 6A usage.</p>
