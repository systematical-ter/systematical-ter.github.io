<h2 id="tech-things">Tech things</h2>
<p>So I mentioned in <a href="/lotta-things-have-happened-tm.html">yesterday's post</a>, I'm looking to make an easier way to record a set of replays of interest (I'm calling them ROIs from now on).</p>
<p>There were a few issues I ran into.</p>
<p>First: it looks like BBCF requires a file called <code>replay_list</code> to agree with the header of a given replay in order for the game to load it. This means I have to update <code>replay_list</code> when I swap out the replays.</p>
<p>Second: <code>replay_list</code>, and the replays themselves, are in binary. I have never worked with binary files before, and will need to figure out what bits align with what information.</p>
<p>My friend and I started looking into reading the replay files to see if we can guesstimate some of the information. First he showed me an important series of commands:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>cat<span class="w"> </span>&lt;file&gt;<span class="w"> </span><span class="p">|</span><span class="w"> </span>hexdump<span class="w"> </span>-C<span class="w"> </span><span class="p">|</span><span class="w"> </span>less
</code></pre></div>

<p>This allowed me to actually read the content of one of these files. (I was not kidding when I said I'd <em>never</em> worked with a binary file before.)</p>
<p>We started taking a look at some of the content of the files, and it didn't seem <em>too</em> bad. Obviously there was a header, and we could clearly see the usernames at the very least. I also made the educated assumption that buttons are stored in 4 bits in hex, e.g. a button press is stored in <code>00 00</code>. I started trying to overthink it with stuff like "How few bits can you store flags as to whether or not 4 buttons are pressed?" but he explained that generally XInput devices store things in 16 bits, and I guesstimated that this game likely does the same (even if it parses it slightly to allow multiple types of controllers).</p>
<p>I also reached out to the modding discord and asked if anyone had already figured out how to parse these files, just because it seemed like it <em>should</em> be a solved problem. Which, turns out it is!</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/libreofficecalc/BBCF-Improvement-Mod/blob/master/src/Game/ReplayFiles/ReplayFile.h">Here is the header file the improvement mod uses to parse a replay file.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/libreofficecalc/BBCF-Improvement-Mod/blob/master/src/Game/ReplayFiles/ReplayList.h">Here is the header file the improvement mod uses to parse the replay_list file.</a></p>
<p>So, I'm going to go off of these in my code to generate a new <code>replay_list</code> file off a provided directory of ROIs.</p>
<p>More here after I do some work on my thesis and make some progress on this. It's going to take a while because it's been a <em>very</em> long time since I've worked in C#, let alone any visual C# and I'm trying to make a UI at the same time as I make the backend functionality.</p>

<p>It felt wrong not to put a personal section.</p>
<p>Uhh.</p>
<p>Uh.</p>
